# E02a-Operators
An exercise exploring python operators and data types

This exercise contains a long list of prompts which require the use of symbols to perform operations. For each set of lines, I have added the second toReturn line, which should perform the operation needed. It begins with simple operations, such as addition. In the first prompt, the program designer has already added the + symbol to add a1 and a2, which are predetermined variables, together. The second prompt follows the same general structure, but I added the - symbol to subtract variable a2 from a1. For the third prompt, I had to add * to multiply a1 by a2 The fourth prompt uses the / symbol to divide a1 by a2. the next set asks for floor division, for which I added // to divide a1 and a2. I then divided with a remainder using the % function. Next, the prompt asked for exponent multiplication, which required ** to perform. The next prompt required a slightly different structure. I used parenthesis in the equation to indicate to the program that the addition needed to be performed first. The next item uses the type() function, which returns the datatype that predetermined variables agree with. Then, i used int() on the next set, which converted predetermined variables into integers and then printed 5 and 1 in the terminal. For the following set i used float(), which converted the given variables into float data pieces. The next set uses str(), which converted the given variable into strings and printed a short message in the terminal. i
